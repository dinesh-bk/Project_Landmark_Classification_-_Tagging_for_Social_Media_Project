# Project Landmark Classification Tagging for Social Media Project
The project involved applying acquired skills from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) course to construct a landmark classifier.

Photo sharing and storage services highly valued location data for each uploaded photo. Leveraging this data, these services could develop advanced functionalities, such as suggesting relevant tags or organizing photos automatically, significantly enhancing the user experience. However, a significant number of uploaded photos did not contain location metadata. This absence of metadata could be due to various reasons, such as the absence of GPS in the capturing camera or the scrubbing of metadata due to privacy concerns.

In instances where no location metadata was available, inferring the location by detecting and classifying discernible landmarks within the image was a potential solution. However, given the vast number of global landmarks and the sheer volume of images uploaded to these services, relying on human judgment for landmark classification was deemed unfeasible.

The initial steps taken in this project addressed this issue by developing models to automatically predict an image's location based on any depicted landmarks. The machine learning design process was employed comprehensively, encompassing data preprocessing, CNN design and training, comparison of different CNNs' accuracies, and deployment of an app based on the best-trained CNN.
